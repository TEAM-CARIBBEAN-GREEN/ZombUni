        <h2>Alexandra Svilarova</h2>

        <p class="infoTeacher">Alex is the head-master's right hand, literally. She took Svetlin's hand and attached it
            for herself. Since then they work great together. She excel in human interactions and contacts. Everyone
            that steps through the doors of ZombUni is immediately seduced and put down to write code.</p>
